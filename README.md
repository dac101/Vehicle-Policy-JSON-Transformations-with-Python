# Vehicle-Policy-JSON-Transformations-with-Python


This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and utilities for converting and transforming vehicle policy data stored in JSON format. The scripts in this repository can be used to manipulate and clean vehicle policy data, as well as convert it into different formats for further analysis or integration with other systems.

To get started, you'll need to have Python 3 and a few common libraries installed on your system, including json, pandas, and xlrd. You can install these dependencies using pip or your preferred package manager.

The repository includes the following files and directories:

convert.py: This script contains functions for converting vehicle policy data from JSON to CSV or Excel formats.
transform.py: This script contains functions for cleaning and transforming vehicle policy data, such as removing null values or renaming columns.
examples/: This directory contains examples of how to use the conversion and transformation functions in your own projects.
tests/: This directory contains unit tests to ensure that the conversion and transformation functions are working correctly.
To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need to clone or download the repository to your local machine. You can then import the conversion and transformation functions into your own Python scripts, or run them directly from the command line.

We hope you find these tools useful for your vehicle policy data management tasks! If you have any questions or suggestions for improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.
